You accidentally clicked "Source Code" under GitHub Releases.
You probably meant to click "Jass2Lua.zip" to download the compiled binaries (or Jass2Lua.Demo.zip for console app)

You can download them here:
https://github.com/speige/Jass2LuaTranspiler/releases/latest/download/Jass2Lua.zip
https://github.com/speige/Jass2LuaTranspiler/releases/latest/download/Jass2Lua.Demo.zip


If you actually want to read the source code, Google how to "clone" the repository instead.
